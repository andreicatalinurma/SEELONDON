                    <h2>fOUR OF THE BEST ATTRACTIONS YOU CAN SEE IN LONDON</h2>
                        <p>To have a perfect trip to London it is necessary to prepare carefully.<br>
                        London is one of the most visited cities in the world, attracting millions of tourists every year thanks to its unique and cosmopolitan feel.<br>
                        Home to the country’s seat of government and lung of its economy, London is impossible to describe in words and a visit to the heart of the city is a must to get a sense of its immensity and its friendly and welcoming atmosphere.<br>
                        <h3 class="attraction-text">Why visit London?</h3><br>
                        London captivates all, bringing culture, light, colour, diversity and fun to all those that visit the city.<br>
                        It is capable of surprising not only first-timers, but also those who return time and time again to discover its endless hidden treasures.

                        Visitors will be able to discover the impressive Big Ben, get a bird’s view of the city from the London Eye or witness the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace.<br>

                    <p>The London Eye is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.<br> It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture.<br> The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).<br> When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel.<br> Its height was surpassed by the 525-foot (160 m) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 550-foot tall (167.6 m) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014.<br> Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel".

                    The London Eye offered the highest public viewing point in London until it was superseded by the 245-metre (804 ft) high observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, which opened to the public on 1 February 2013.

                    The London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth.</p>

            <h2>Big Ben</h2>
            <div class="grid-attraction1">
                <div class="grid-1a">
                    <p>The truth about Big Ben:<br>
                    When we envisage Big Ben, we normally think of the Parliament’s clock tower. However, Big Ben is actually the clock’s Great Bell, which weighs 14 tons and is found inside the tower called Elizabeth Tower.<br>The gothic-styled tower standing 315 feet (96 m) high holds a four-faced clock and was built in 1858 at the far end of the Parliament.<br>

                    British punctuality:<br>
                    Big Ben’s four-faced clock is set in a 23 feet (7m) frame on all sides of the Tower and was completed in May 1859.<br> It has become one of the most recognisable British icons and its chimes are broadcasted by BBC radio every day.<br>

                    It is one of the world’s most reliable clocks, withstanding rain, wind and snow.<br> It even kept chiming during the bombing attacks of World War II.  

                    Although there are few occasions when Big Ben has suffered punctuality incidents, Londoners will never forget 1962 New Year’s Eve, when the clock chimed the new year 10 minutes late due to the harsh weather conditions.

                    However, between 2017 and 2021 the clock will fall silent (except for special occasions such as New Year's eve and Remembrance Sunday) as work is done on the clock mechanism itself, ensuring that Big Ben will continue to work smoothly well into the future. </p>

            <h2>Buchingham Palace</h2>
            <div class="grid-attraction1">
                <div class="grid-1a">
                    <p>History:<br>
                    Built in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham, the building was acquired by King George III in 1762 as a private residence.<br> Since the eighteenth century, the palace has been enlarged and remodelled on several occasions.<br>

                    Extraordinarily, the palace survived the air attacks during the two World Wars. During World War I, the Palace remained unharmed.<br> However, during World War II it was bombed on several occasions, destroying the palace chapel in 1940.<br>

                    Visiting Buckingham Palace:<br>
                    Tourists can visit the Royal Palace, but it is only open to the public a couple of months a year: between July and October.<br> If you are in London during these months, you can either buy the least expensive ticket which gives you access to the State Rooms and Buckingham Palace, or you can purchase slightly more expensive tickets which include a visit to the Royal Mews and The Queen’s Gallery.<br>

                    As well as visiting Buckingham Palace, the Changing of the Guard takes place in the forecourt throughout the year, attracting thousands of travelers annually.<br>

                    The Changing of the Guard usually takes place at 11am on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Mondays.</p>

            <div class="grid-attraction1">
                <div class="grid-1a">
                    <p>Construction of the Tower Bridge:<br>
                    Several bridges were constructed to connect the two sides of the Thames as London expanded.<br>

                    The first bridge to be built was the London Bridge and soon many followed, all completed to the west of this bridge as not to disturb the port area.<br>

                    During the nineteenth century London developed immensely on the east side of London Bridge and a new bridge was necessary.<br> It was decided that the best option was to build a drawbridge to allow the flow of ships on the River Thames.<br> The two sides of the bridge would be lifted by vapour machines.<br> It was inaugurated in 1894, eight years behind schedule.<br> 
                    Visiting Tower Bridge:<br>
                    During your visit to the Tower Bridge you’ll witness how the bridge’s elevation system worked from 1894 to 1976, thanks to a vapour machine and its later substitution by an electrical system.
                    London’s iconic symbol:<br>
                    Tower Bridge is one of the most emblematic symbols of London and makes for a beautiful photo of Britain’s capital.<br> Visitors will learn how the bridge was constructed if they visit the inside of Tower Bridge.<br> However, we do not consider it an essential visit.</p>
